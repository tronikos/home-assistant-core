"""Bluetooth Low Energy transport for the ELM327 OBD-II adapter.

Subclasses :class:`obdii.transports.transport_base.TransportBase` to
provide a :mod:`bleak`-backed sync+async transport with GATT
notify-based reads, dynamic UUID fallback discovery, and context
manager support.

The sync API (``connect``, ``close``, ``write_bytes``, ``read_bytes``)
is called from the poller on the executor thread. The async API
(``async_connect``, ``async_close``, ``_write``) runs on the event
loop, dispatched via :meth:`_run_coro` which uses
:func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
